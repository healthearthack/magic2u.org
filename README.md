> **Consolidation status:** This repository is the canonical Magic2U working
> archive. The newest complete source snapshot is expanded at the root. Thirteen
> byte-unique historical ZIPs and the standalone showcase are preserved under
> [`artifacts/`](./artifacts/README.md) so earlier work remains recoverable while
> the runnable product is stabilized.

**Enterprise-grade design infrastructure — tokens, components, observability, and governance at scale.**

## What Is Magic2U Design System?

Magic2U DS is a production-ready cloud based design system platform built to serve enterprise-scale healthcare digital products. It is not just a component library — it is a **full-stack design infrastructure** that unifies token governance, multi-theme architecture, accessibility automation, component telemetry, and performance observability across every team and surface that touches the product.

Built for the scale of organizations serving **51 million+ members**, Magic2U DS reduces engineering duplication, enforces consistent UX, and gives leadership real data on design system adoption and ROI.

## Who is this process for? 

> Companies without design systems yet and may include teams with multiple digital products and inconsistent UI that seek governance, speed, and consistency.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Install |
|------|---------|---------|
| Node.js | ≥ 18.x | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |

import 'magic2u-design-system/ui/styles/base.css';
import { Button, Card, StatCard } from 'magic2u-design-system/ui/react';

export function MyPage() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <StatCard label="Members" value="51M" trend="up" delta="+3.2%" />
      <Button variant="primary" onClick={() => {}}>
        Get Started
      </Button>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

## Core Pillars

### 🎨 Token-Driven Design
Every visual decision — color, spacing, border radius, typography, shadow — is a design token. Tokens are defined once in JSON, transformed by Style Dictionary, and consumed as CSS custom properties, JS constants, or platform-native values. Change a token; everything updates in sync.

### ⚛️ React Component Library
A typed, accessible, tree-shakeable React 18 component library. Every component is built against the token system, documented in Storybook, and tested for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance before merge.

### 🌐 Web Components (Shadow DOM)
Framework-agnostic Web Components built with Shadow DOM allow any tech stack — Vue, Angular, plain HTML, legacy CMS — to consume the design system without adopting React.

### 📡 Telemetry & Observability
The `useTelemetry` and `useMetrics` hooks give teams real-time insight into component render performance, adoption rates per team, and error surfaces. Data is aggregated into the enterprise metrics dashboard.

### ♿ Accessibility Automation
Every PR triggers an automated accessibility check workflow. The PR checklist enforces manual a11y review before merge. Accessibility score targets are tracked as a first-class metric.

### 🔐 Governance at Scale
Structured issue templates (bug, feature, design proposal), PR checklists, CODEOWNERS, and Changeset-based semantic versioning ensure that contributions from any team member follow the same process.
